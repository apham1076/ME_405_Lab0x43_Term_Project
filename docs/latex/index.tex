This project was completed as part of {\bfseries{ME 405\+: Mechatronics}} at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The objective was to design and implement a fully autonomous Romi robot capable of reliably completing a printed line-\/following time-\/trial course using onboard sensing, real-\/time control, and a cooperative multitasking software architecture.

The final system integrates closed-\/loop motor control, encoder-\/based feedback, reflectance sensor processing, and task-\/level coordination to achieve repeatable and robust performance. Design decisions prioritized reliability, modularity, and predictable behavior over purely maximizing speed.

The robot is built on a Pololu Romi chassis with two DC motors driven by onboard motor drivers and instrumented with quadrature encoders for wheel position and velocity feedback. Line detection is performed using a reflectance sensor array mounted at the front of the chassis and positioned to provide consistent contrast while minimizing sensitivity to ambient lighting.

Power is supplied by {\bfseries{six AA batteries}}. Several electrical design decisions were made to ensure predictable startup behavior, including modifying default pull-\/up configurations and selecting motor control pins to prevent unintended motion on power-\/up. Encoder wiring, sensor placement, and cable management were refined to improve repeatability and robustness during operation.

The firmware is organized using a {\bfseries{cooperative multitasking framework}} implemented in Micro\+Python. Independent tasks handle sensing, control, actuation, and communication, and they exchange information using thread-\/safe shared variables and queues.

This structure allows time-\/critical operations, such as motor updates and sensor sampling, to execute deterministically while higher-\/level logic runs concurrently without blocking. The modular task design simplified debugging and enabled incremental development throughout the quarter.

Wheel encoders provide continuous feedback for closed-\/loop motor control. A proportional–integral controller regulates wheel velocity, allowing the robot to track commanded setpoints consistently across operating conditions.
