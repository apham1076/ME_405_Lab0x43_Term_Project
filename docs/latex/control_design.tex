Achieving reliable line-\/following performance required both stable closed-\/loop control and accurate measurement of wheel motion. Throughout development, significant effort was spent refining encoder velocity estimation, task timing, and control parameters to improve smoothness and consistency.

This section highlights the iterative process used to characterize and improve system behavior.

Open-\/loop step response tests were used to evaluate how changes in motor effort translated to wheel velocity. These tests exposed limitations in early velocity estimation approaches and informed subsequent improvements.

Improvements to encoder velocity calculations and adjustments to the motor control task period significantly reduced measurement noise. Increasing the time interval between velocity calculations improved numerical stability while preserving responsiveness.

These measurement improvements directly enabled more effective closed-\/loop control. With reduced noise in velocity feedback, proportional–integral gains could be tuned to achieve stable tracking without excessive oscillation or overshoot.

The refined control behavior contributed to reliable line-\/following performance, particularly during transitions involving sharp curvature or rapid changes in commanded motion.

Rather than relying solely on controller tuning, performance gains were achieved through careful attention to measurement quality and task timing. This iterative approach proved essential for achieving smooth, repeatable behavior in the final system.
